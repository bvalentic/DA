Password salting is a technique used to make password storage more secure. It involves adding a random value, known as a salt, to the password before hashing it. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables of hashes, known as rainbow tables, to crack the password.

Here's how password salting works:

When a user creates an account, a random salt value is generated.
The salt value is added to the password, and the resulting string is hashed using a one-way hash function, such as SHA-256 or bcrypt.
The hashed password and the salt value are stored in the database.
When the user tries to log in, the following process occurs:

The salt value is retrieved from the database.
The salt value is added to the entered password, and the resulting string is hashed using the same one-way hash function used during account creation.
The hashed password is compared to the hashed password stored in the database.
If the two hashed passwords match, the user is granted access. If they don't match, the user is denied access.

The salt value is not a secret, and it's typically stored alongside the hashed password in the database. The purpose of the salt is to make it more difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables of hashes to crack the password.

For example, let's say an attacker has a precomputed table of hashes for common passwords, such as "password123". Without salting, the attacker could simply look up the hash for "password123" in their table and find the corresponding password. But with salting, the attacker would need to compute the hash for "password123" with the specific salt value used for that user's account. This makes it much more difficult for the attacker to crack the password.

In summary, password salting is a technique used to make password storage more secure by adding a random value to the password before hashing it. This makes it more difficult for attackers to use precomputed tables of hashes to crack the password.
