In the comb sort, explain the XOR swap trick.

The XOR swap trick is a clever way to swap two variables without using a temporary variable. It works by exploiting the properties of the bitwise XOR operation.

Here's how it works:

1. arr[i] ^= arr[i + gap]; - This line performs an XOR operation between arr[i] and arr[i + gap], and stores the result back in arr[i]. This has the effect of "moving" the value of arr[i + gap] into arr[i], while also "remembering" the original value of arr[i].
2. arr[i + gap] ^= arr[i]; - This line performs an XOR operation between arr[i + gap] and the new value of arr[i] (which now contains the original value of arr[i + gap]). This has the effect of "moving" the original value of arr[i] into arr[i + gap].
3. arr[i] ^= arr[i + gap]; - This line performs another XOR operation between arr[i] and arr[i + gap]. Since arr[i + gap] now contains the original value of arr[i], this operation effectively "cancels out" the first XOR operation, leaving arr[i] with the original value of arr[i + gap].

The net effect of these three operations is that the values of arr[i] and arr[i + gap] are swapped, without using a temporary variable.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

Suppose we want to swap the values of x and y, which are 5 and 10, respectively.

x = 5
y = 10

x ^= y; // x becomes 15 (5 ^ 10)
y ^= x; // y becomes 5 (10 ^ 15)
x ^= y; // x becomes 10 (15 ^ 5)

// Now x is 10 and y is 5

The XOR swap trick is often used in low-level programming or when working with limited resources, as it can be more efficient than using a temporary variable. However, it's important to note that it may not be as readable or intuitive as using a temporary variable, so it's generally recommended to use it only when necessary.
