Here are some ways the IsPrime method can be improved:

1. **Optimize Loop Condition**: The loop condition in the current implementation checks up to `i * i <= n`. This is because a larger factor of the number would have already been found earlier in the iteration process, so there's no need to check beyond this point.

2. **Use Math.Sqrt() Method**: Instead of using `i * i` as the upper limit for the loop, you could use `Math.Sqrt(n)` which will give more accurate results and avoid potential overflow issues with large numbers.

3. **Check Divisibility by 2 First**: Since all even numbers greater than 2 are not prime, we can add an initial check at the beginning of the function that returns false if the input number is divisible by 2.

4. **Skip Checking Even Numbers After Initial Check**: If the initial check passes (the number is odd), then it cannot be divided evenly by any other even number. Therefore, after checking divisibility by 2 initially, we only need to iterate over odd numbers within our loop.

5. **Early Exit When Factor Found**: As soon as we find a divisor, we know the number isn't prime, so we should return false immediately instead of continuing through the rest of the iterations.

6. **Consider Using Bitwise Operations**: For very large inputs, bitwise operations might provide faster performance when determining whether or not a given integer has factors less than its square root.

7. **Memoization**: You could store previously computed values in a cache to speed up future calls to the function with the same arguments.

8. **Parallel Processing**: Depending on your specific requirements, parallel processing techniques like multi-threading or distributed computing may help improve performance for certain types of computations involving primality testing.

9. **Using Probabilistic Primality Tests**: There exist probabilistic algorithms such as Miller-Rabin test that offer better time complexity but also come with trade-offs regarding accuracy. These tests work well for most practical purposes where absolute certainty about primality is not required.

10. **Leverage Pre-Computed Tables**: In cases where memory usage isn't a concern, pre-computing tables of known primes can significantly accelerate lookups compared to calculating them from scratch each time.
